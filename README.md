This was an additional team assignment in a PHP course, where I collaborated with four proficient classmates. Together, we established a project on GitHub, emphasizing various elements such as functions, logic, CSS, and data management. My responsibility involved handling data management through MySQL. Whenever faced with challenges, I resolved them through self-learning. We maintained a flexible working approach, engaging in discussions and finding solutions on Teams, and also had enjoyable moments throughout the process. By the semester's end, we successfully completed the project, and the teamwork experience underscored the value of both collaborative efforts and independent work.
